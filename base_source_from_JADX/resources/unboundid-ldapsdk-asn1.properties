ERR_SET_DECODE_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE=Unable to decode the provided ASN.1 element {0} as a set because the decoded length of an embedded element exceeds the number of bytes remaining.
ERR_BOOLEAN_INVALID_LENGTH=ASN.1 Boolean elements must have a value whose length is exactly one byte.
ERR_READ_END_BEFORE_FIRST_LENGTH=The end of the input stream was reached before the first length byte could be read.
ERR_SET_BYTES_DECODE_EXCEPTION=Unable to decode the provided byte array as a set\:  {0}
ERR_NULL_HAS_VALUE=ASN.1 null elements must not have a value.
ERR_STREAM_READER_SET_READ_PAST_END=The ASN.1 stream reader has already read beyond the end of this set (expected set of length {0} to end at {1} bytes into the stream, but {2} bytes have already been read from the stream).
ERR_LONG_INVALID_LENGTH=Invalid value length of {0,number,0} for an ASN.1 long element.  Long element values must have a length between 1 and 8 bytes.
ERR_SEQUENCE_BYTES_DECODE_EXCEPTION=Unable to decode the provided byte array as a sequence\:  {0}
ERR_SET_DECODE_EXCEPTION=Unable to decode the provided ASN.1 element {0} as a set\:  {1}
ERR_SEQUENCE_DECODE_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE=Unable to decode the provided ASN.1 element {0} as a sequence because the decoded length of an embedded element exceeds the number of bytes remaining.
ERR_READ_END_BEFORE_VALUE_END=The end of the input stream was reached before the full value could be read.

ERR_ELEMENT_DECODE_EXCEPTION=Unable to decode the provided byte array as an ASN.1 BER element\:  {0}
ERR_ELEMENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH=The decoded length of {0,number,0} does not match the number of bytes remaining in the provided array ({1,number,0}).
ERR_STREAM_READER_SEQUENCE_READ_PAST_END=The ASN.1 stream reader has already read beyond the end of this sequence (expected sequence of length {0} to end at {1} bytes into the stream, but {2} bytes have already been read from the stream).
ERR_SET_BYTES_DECODE_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE=Unable to decode the provided byte array as a set because the decoded length of an embedded element exceeds the number of bytes remaining.
ERR_READ_LENGTH_TOO_LONG=The element indicated that it required {0,number,0} bytes to encode the multi-byte length, but multi-byte lengths must be encoded in 1 to 4 bytes.
ERR_ENUMERATED_INVALID_LENGTH=Invalid value length of {0,number,0} for an ASN.1 enumerated element.  Enumerated element values must have a length between 1 and 4 bytes.
ERR_INTEGER_INVALID_LENGTH=Invalid value length of {0,number,0} for an ASN.1 integer element.  Integer element values must have a length between 1 and 4 bytes.
ERR_SEQUENCE_BYTES_DECODE_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE=Unable to decode the provided byte array as a sequence because the decoded length of an embedded element exceeds the number of bytes remaining.
ERR_SEQUENCE_DECODE_EXCEPTION=Unable to decode the provided ASN.1 element {0} as a sequence\:  {1}
ERR_READ_END_BEFORE_LENGTH_END=The end of the input stream was reached before the full length could be read.
ERR_READ_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_MAX=The element indicated that it required {0,number,0} bytes to hold the value, but this is larger than the maximum of {1,number,0} bytes that the client has been configured to accept.
